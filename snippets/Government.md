Governmental/'public sector' orders, being COERCIVE MONOPOLIES which get their life/order-sustaining wealth through taxes/compulsion are immune to the competitive-information-spreading incentives/pressures which motivate/force private sector orders to be efficient/innovative so they obviously don't have "to work harder, to change habits, or to devote a degree of attention, continuous application, or regularity to their work" which should help one further understand how Communism, which abolishes competing orders and replaces them with a single competition-less monopolistic bureaucracy, lacks both incentives/pressures to innovate/learn as well as "work harder" thus leading to a massive lack of production/innovation and eventually socioeconomic chaos/starvation as the economic pie continuously shrinks as has happened in every country that consciously attempts Communism/Socialism or inadvertently drifts in that direction as their governments get bigger and bigger (USA/Word). The image below is another one of our most powerful memes for explaining the difference between competitive/private orders(South Korea) and monopolistic/government orders (North Korea). Again, keep your eye on how information arises/spreads and continuously restructures the social order.
