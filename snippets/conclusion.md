Mises: 

>"Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plungedÂ us."

If mankind destroys itself, it will do so because those of us who had the miraculous luck of stumbling upon Mises/Hayek failed to spread their econogospel to fellow slightly smarter apes. The time to join Mises and go over the parapet in his "intellectual battle" against the economic ignorance that underpins our problems is right now.
